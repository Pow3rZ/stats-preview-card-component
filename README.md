## My process

Most of my problems were with the image. I knew how to change color of background-image by blending it with background-color. I also knew how easy it was to change background-image url with media queries so I stick for some time with doing it this method, but lost to problems with sizing of div with that background image.
Than i changed approach and tried to do it with simple img elements and i found it much easier to do.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Img src switching depending on screen size.

Img blending with background.

Positives of mobile-first approach (smaller easier to read css file).


### Useful resources

- [w3schools article about srcset](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_source_srcset.asp) - This helped me with switching images depending on window size without javascript.
